#+TITLE: 2 - Echo Sutta To Web Endpoint

This week's challenge: how to get app and webserver to use the ~random_sutta~ function

* Homework due <2022-02-10 Thu>
** TODO Add run.py that imports __init__.py
The first thing I needed to understand was how to source other python files when running python
** TODO Pull in flask as a dependency to flake
** TODO Compose ~server.py~ that is responsible for the flask webserver
***  TODO Define a consumable web endpoint
 I'm looking for the GET verb and can ignore others
